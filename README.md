# Classic Algorithms
Data structures and common algorithms playground. As wel
As always more an exercice for me to think their implementation rather than anything useful.

## Contents

### Theory

- [Memory Management in C++](theory/memory_management.md)
- LeetCode-like problems approach guide

### Array Sorting:

- Bubble Sort (Serial)
- Bubble Sort / Odd-Even Sort (Parallel)
- Merge Sort (Parallel)
- Heap Sort (Serial)
- Quick Sort (Serial)

### Uninformed Tree Search:

- Pre-order DFS
- In-order DFS
- Post-order DFS

### Graph Search:

**Uninformed:**

- BFS (Breath First Search)
- DFS (Depth First Search)

**Informed:**

- Greedy (Expand lowest heuristic node)
- Dijkstra (Expand lowest acquisition_cost node)
- A* (Expand lowest heuristic + acquisition_cost node)

### MetaHeuristics for Optimization:

- Genetic algorithm
- Simulated Annealing
- Ant Colony
- Tabu Search

### Data Structures

- Tree
- BST (Binnary Search Tree)
- Graph
