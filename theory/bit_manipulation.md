# Bit Manipulation

## Reading binary numbers:

```
8421
0101 = 5
1010 = 10
```
## Basic operations:

__+, -, *__: Same as in base 10 but in base 2.

```
0110 + 0010 = 1000
0110 - 0011 = 0011
0011 * 0101 = 1111
```
__OBS__: In case of doubt you can always convert to base 10, do operation there and convert back.

## Bit-wise operations:

__NEG (~)__, __OR ||__, __AND &__, __XOR (Exclusive OR) ^__ (Only true if exactly one bit is true)
